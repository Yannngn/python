Hello, I&#39;m Henrique and this here is reb energ [Music] [Applause] Tech one of the releases I liked the most this year was reer Plus and when I saw energent Tech I assumed it was a simpler version of Tech Plus silly  The Energent Tech is an entry-level model from Rebok designed for daily training with little technological content, high weight and which uses the PH yarn foam present in the Rebok Energy and Run 3 and when I say entry-level model I mean to enter through the pipe the adjustment  It&#39;s more or less, I gave it a rating of 7, but the comfort and cushioning is poor, it&#39;s softer to run with traditional Dutch clogs than with Energent Tech, rating 6, the running experience is a very difficult task, not only because of the weight but also because of the general inability of the foam.  and for the work as a whole, a rating of 6.5 and how beautiful this animal is. It received a rating of 6.5 for style and the price of R 300 seems even a little high, rating of 7 for value for money, my recommendation was very simple rebok Energy Tech reb  energ Tech Plus and using my weighted average methodology which is predicting that Meng√£o has a real chance of being Brazilian champion, we reached a regrettable final score of 6.6 for energ [Music] Tech this video only has good things, the combination of Beatles socks  with these stori duren Duran sneakers
